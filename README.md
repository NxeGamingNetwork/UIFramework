# UIFramework
A powerful UI framework for the game Onset (https://playonset.com/).

`The framework is still under development, so functions can be replaced by new ones at any time. You should always consider this when updating to a new version.`

#### Why should I not use the Onset WebUI directly?
Of course you can also use the WebUI directly and have more possibilities.
But sometimes with a good UI framework you get awesome results a lot faster and easier, so you have more time to develop the main logic of your extension.
Another point is that no HTML or CSS knowledge is required for this UI framework, but if you have knowledge of HTML and CSS, the framework can easily be extended with new features.

#### Any help is welcome!
1. download/fork the framework
2. modify 
3. send a pull request with your changes
4. if the changes are good, I will accept them

_And that's it! So easy!_

#### Why should I help?
I started this project to help other people develop extensions for Onset.
There are many people who have good ideas for Onset, but need help with a user interface.
Together we can achieve more! And we all want more good extensions for Onset. ðŸ˜‰
